# Machine-Learing-Project
This is my Kaggle Submission for my Machine Learning Project, Where I used machine learning to predict if a passenger would survive or not.

I estimated using paremters: 'Age', 'Sex', 'Pclass' and 'Fare'.
All parameters were chosen based on Statistical significance for survivability.

I used Random Decision Tree Classification.
